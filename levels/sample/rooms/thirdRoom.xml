own self-contained file. This isn't fundamentally necessary, but it's very
natural. It also allows you to very easily load content only once a room

	<!-- The map is a special black-and-white image describing walkable areas in
	a room. White pixels are walkable, black are unwalkable. This actually consumes
	a very large amount of memory to use, so we keep the scaled down. I find 50%
	scale is a good compromise for performance/accuracy. However in sufficiently
	large rooms this is still too much, and 25% scale in necessary. This leads to
	a substantial sarcifice in hit-detection quality, so avoid big rooms!-->

	the dimensions of the room from this, which is used to specify the area the
