own self-contained file. This isn't fundamentally necessary, but it's very
natural. It also allows you to very easily load content only once a room

    <!-- The map is a special black-and-white image describing walkable areas in
	a room. White pixels are walkable, black are unwalkable. This actually consumes
	a very large amount of memory to use, so we keep the scaled down. I find 50%
	scale is a good compromise for performance/accuracy. However in sufficiently
	large rooms this is still too much, and 25% scale in necessary. This leads to
	a substantial sarcifice in hit-detection quality, so avoid big rooms!-->

	loaded in earlier. Also note the scale variable specifying how much this map
	should be scaled up for it to reflect the actual room size. We also derive
	the dimensions of the room from this, which is used to specify the area the
	camera can see. However width and height can be explicitly
	specified here if need be. The walkableMap is theoretically optional, but
	it's incredibly useful and easy to use. -->

   how many there are and how big they are, and the system will find all of them
   and tile them correctly based on their names. This also makes it very easy
